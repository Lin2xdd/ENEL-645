# Question:
parameters vs hyperparameters
do we also split development set into training set and validation set 
the bias in test set for the first experiment design???? what's the bias
step-wise slection to avoid over-fitting?

to split a dataset into training, validation, test? 
validation set vs test set? just a bigger validation set?

#experiment design
## train vs validation vs test
for large dataset, the training time is long, we only do one iteration, that's why we don't do k-fold iterations
one single dataset split into three, shuffle the data first before splitting
training set: values for the parameters(path) to select the best model
test set: to see the generalization of the training set 
ratio: 80 for training 20 for validation, test set is large enough to select the best performance, very flexible
### Workflow
Train model on tarining set, select the best one on validation set, and verify and find problems with test set, and then improve your model on train set, etc


## k-fold
a signgle dataset 
for small data, we can do multiple iterations to compensate the insufficient data
- bootstrapping

# Over-fitting
- Noise also included, goes over the essential trend, poor generalization; sample isn't learned rather just memorized
- epoch: 1 epoch = 1 complete learning iteration on training 
   - after each epoch on the training set, go to validation set and calculate the validation error
   - The turnpoint of the validation error is the best model in terms of fitting
   - Step-wise selection?
   - Sometimes we need to select between multiple validation curves more than just one; hyperparameters == models,  we select the best model on each hyperparameter combo, and select the best one of all
   - no threshold on val error/trainig error as a good indicator of over-fitting
   - sometimes the curve have multiple minimums
## Techniques
- Dropout used in Neural networks
- Regular regularization for the polynomial example
- L2 regularization in the loss function?? set the only hyperparameter of lambda by ourselves


   
### Hints
Linear model: depends on the parameters not independent variables
